          <h3>Our story</h3>
          <p>
SHARPCODE was born from a realization: countless students lacked practical skills in computer science, hindering their ability to secure internships, work on live projects, and craft compelling resumes and LinkedIn profiles. This gap led to challenges in securing placements, affecting the student community as a whole. With this insight, SHARPCODE emerged as a solution, aiming to bridge this crucial gap and empower students with the practical skills needed to excel in the industry.

          <h3>Students First</h3>
          <p>
At SHARPCODE, we understand that not every student has access to a structured learning guide. Many students juggle demanding schedules, participate in extracurricular activities, and even shoulder responsibilities for loved ones while pursuing their studies. Recognizing these challenges, we developed a self-paced learning internship program. This unique approach allows students to learn at their own pace, gaining valuable skills along the way. Upon completion, students are not only equipped with essential knowledge but are also eligible to work on live projects, preparing them for real-world challenges in their chosen field.
